#After that we will be taking into account different customized majors maybe a student might be interested in that is like Science and Maths Major which will make him require the schools to be good in Algebra, Geometry, Physics and Chemistry. Also he can take a social sciences major which might make him take subjects like Earth Science, Global History and US History. Therefore I have covered almost all different majors that a student wishes to take up in the future and which schools are the best for that.
